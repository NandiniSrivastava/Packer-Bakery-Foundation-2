ðŸš€ How Docker Bake Works

Instead of manually running multiple docker build commands, Docker Bake allows you to define build targets in a docker-bake.hcl file and execute them together using:

docker buildx bake

âœ¨ Benefits of Docker Bake:

âœ… Multi-Platform Builds (e.g., Linux/AMD64 & Linux/ARM64)âœ… Parallel Builds (faster builds using BuildKit)âœ… Centralized Build Config (uses YAML/HCL format)âœ… CI/CD Friendly (easily integrates into pipelines)

ðŸ›  Example Workflow

Step 1: Define Build Targets in docker-bake.hcl

Create a docker-bake.hcl file in the root directory:

group "default" {
    targets = ["python-bakery"]
}

target "python-bakery" {
    context    = "."
    dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
    platforms  = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
    tags       = ["yourusername/python-bakery:latest"]
}

Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

Write the Dockerfile for your Python 3.9 image:

FROM ubuntu:20.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    python3.9 python3.9-venv python3.9-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

CMD ["python3"]

Step 3: Build and Push Using Docker Bake

Run the following command to build and push the image:

docker buildx bake --push

âœ… Builds Python 3.9 images for both AMD64 and ARM64âœ… Pushes the images to Docker Hub automatically


ðŸš€ Conclusion

Docker Bake simplifies multi-platform and parallel builds, making it a powerful tool for CI/CD pipelines and scalable Docker environments.
